# Purpose: Check if there is a TimeCapsule in your network and mount it
#     for use it under Gnu/Linux. Unmount it if it is already mounted.
#          The mount point is created and destroyed after use (for prevent
#          automatic backup software to backup in the directory if the device
#          is not mounted)
# Instructions:
#   1) Install cifs-utils (sudo apt-get install cifs-utils)
#   2) Install Dolphin or change to your preferred file manager
#   3) Change the first four variables according to your configuration.
#   4) Run this program at boot when your network is already
#   set up. Also, run it on logoff to umount Time Capsule.
#   Run it as root (in kde you can prefix the command via kdesu)
